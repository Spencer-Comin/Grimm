So he wandered several years in misery
until at last he came to the desert place where Rapunzel lived
with her twin-children that she had borne, a boy and a girl.

At first he heard a voice that he thought he knew,
and when he reached the place from which it seemed to come Rapunzel knew him,
and fell on his neck and wept.

And when her tears touched his eyes they became clear again,
and he could see with them as well as ever.
