"I have had enough now,"
    said the frog at last,
"and as I am tired, you must carry me to your room,
"and make ready your silken bed, and we will lie down and go to sleep."

Then the King's daughter began to weep, and was afraid of the cold frog,
that nothing would satisfy him but he must sleep in her pretty clean bed.

Now the King grew angry with her, saying:
    "That which thou hast promised in thy time of necessity,
    "must thou now perform."

So she picked up the frog with her finger and thumb, carried him upstairs
and put him in a corner, and when she had lain down to sleep,
he came creeping up, saying:
    "I am tired and want sleep as much as you;
    "take me up, or I will tell your father."

Then she felt beside herself with rage, and picking him up,
she threw him with all her strength against the wall, crying:
    "Now will you be quiet, you horrid frog!"

But as he fell, he ceased to be a frog,
and became all at once a prince with beautiful kind eyes.

And it came to pass that, with her father's consent,
they became bride and bridegroom.

And he told her how a wicked witch had bound him by her spells,
and how no one but she alone could have released him,
and that they two would go together to his father's kingdom.
