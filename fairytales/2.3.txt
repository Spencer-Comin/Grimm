Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing.
He said to the mouse,
    "You must do me a favor,
    "and once more manage the house alone for a day.
    "I have been asked again to be godfather,
    "and since the child has a white ring around its neck,
    "I cannot refuse."

The good mouse consented.

However, the cat crept behind the town wall to the church,
and devoured half the pot of fat.

"Nothing tastes as good as that which one eats by oneself,"
    he said, and was quite satisfied with his day's work.
