The wood-cutter obeyed, brought his child,
and gave her to the Virgin Mary, who took her up to heaven with her.

There the child fared well, ate sugar-cakes, and drank sweet milk,
and her clothes were of gold, and the little angels played with her.

And when she was fourteen years of age,
the Virgin Mary called her one day and said:
    "Dear child, I am about to make a long journey,
    "so take into thy keeping the keys of the thirteen doors of heaven.
    "Twelve of these thou mayest open,
    "and behold the glory which is within them,
    "but the thirteenth, to which this little key belongs,
    "is forbidden thee.
    "Beware of opening it, or thou wilt bring misery on thyself."

The girl promised to be obedient, and when the Virgin Mary was gone,
she began to examine the dwellings of the kingdom of heaven.

Each day she opened one of them, until she had made the round of the twelve.

In each of them sat one of the Apostles in the midst of a great light,
and she rejoiced in all the magnificence and splendour,
and the little angels who always accompanied her rejoiced with her.

Then the forbidden door alone remained,
and she felt a great desire to know what could be hidden behind it,
and said to the angels:
    "I will not quite open it, and I will not go inside it,
    "but I will unlock it so that we can just see a little through the opening."

"Oh no,"
    said the little angels,
"that would be a sin.
"The Virgin Mary has forbidden it,
"and it might easily cause thy unhappiness."

Then she was silent, but the desire in her heart was not stilled,
but gnawed there and tormented her, and let her have no rest.
