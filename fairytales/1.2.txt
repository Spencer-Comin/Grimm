But the frog, as soon as he heard her promise,
drew his head under the water and sank down out of sight,
but after a while he came to the surface again with the ball in his mouth,
and he threw it on the grass.

The King's daughter was overjoyed to see her pretty plaything again,
and she caught it up and ran off with it.

"Stop, stop!"
    cried the frog,
"take me up too. I cannot run as fast as you!"

But it was of no use, for croak, croak after her as he might,
she would not listen to him, but made haste home,
and very soon forgot all about the poor frog,
who had to betake himself to his well again.
