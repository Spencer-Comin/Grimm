A cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse,
and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship that he felt for her,
that at last the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.

"But we must make preparations for winter,
"or else we shall suffer from hunger,"
    said the cat,
"and you, little mouse, cannot venture out everywhere,
"or in the end you will be caught in a trap."

This good advice was followed, and they bought a pot of fat,
but they did not know where to store it.

Finally, after much consideration, the cat said,
    "I know of no place where it will be better stored up than in the church.
    "No one dares take anything away from there.
    "We will put it beneath the altar,
    "and not touch it until we are really in need of it."
