Hard by a great forest dwelt a wood-cutter with his wife,
who had an only child, a little girl three years old.

They were so poor, however, that they no longer had daily bread,
and did not know how to get food for her.

One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest,
and while he was cutting wood, suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman
with a crown of shining stars on her head, who said to him:
    "I am the Virgin Mary, mother of the child Jesus.
    "Thou art poor and needy, bring thy child to me,
    "I will take her with me and be her mother, and care for her."
