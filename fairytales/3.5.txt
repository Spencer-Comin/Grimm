One day, when the trees were once more clothed in fresh green,
the King of the country was hunting in the forest, and followed a roe,
and as it had fled into the thicket which shut in this part of the forest,
he got off his horse, tore the bushes asunder, and cut himself a path with his sword.

When he had at last forced his way through,
he saw a wonderfully beautiful maiden sitting under the tree;
and she sat there and was entirely covered with her golden hair down to her very feet.

He stood still and looked at her full of surprise, then he spoke to her and said:
    "Who art thou?
    "Why art thou sitting here in the wilderness?"

But she gave no answer, for she could not open her mouth.
