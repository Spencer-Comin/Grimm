So the pot was stored safely away,
but it was not long before the cat took a great longing for it,
and said to the mouse,
    "I wanted to tell you, little mouse,
    "that my cousin has brought a little son into the world,
    "and she has asked me to be his godfather.
    "He is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the baptismal font.
    "Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself."

"Yes, yes,"
    answered the mouse.
"By all means go, and if you get anything good to eat, think of me.
"I would like to drink a drop of sweet red christening wine myself."

All this, however, was untrue.

The cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godfather.

He went straight to the church, crept up to the pot of fat,
began to lick at it, and licked off the top of the fat.

Then he went for a stroll on the roofs of the town,
looked out for opportunities, and then stretched out in the sun,
licking his whiskers whenever he thought of the pot of fat.

He did not return home until it was evening.

"Well, here you are again,"
    said the mouse.
"You must have had a happy day."

"Everything went well,"
    answered the cat.

"What name did they give the child?"
    asked the mouse.

"Top-Off,"
    said the cat quite coolly.

"Top-Off?"
    cried the mouse.
"That is a very odd and uncommon name.
"Is it a usual one in your family?"

"What does that matter?"
    said the cat.
"It is no worse than Crumb-Thief,
"as your godchildren are called."
