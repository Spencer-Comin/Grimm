And there came to the door a carriage drawn by eight white horses,
with white plumes on their heads, and with golden harness,
and behind the carriage was standing faithful Henry,
the servant of the young prince.

Now,
faithful Henry had suffered such care and pain when his master was turned into a frog,
that he had been obliged to wear three iron bands over his heart,
to keep it from breaking with trouble and anxiety.

When the carriage started to take the prince to his kingdom,
and faithful Henry had helped them both in,
he got up behind, and was full of joy at his master's deliverance.

And when they had gone a part of the way,
the prince heard a sound at the back of the carriage,
as if something had broken, and he turned round and cried:
    "Henry, the wheel must be breaking!"

"The wheel does not break,
"'Tis the band round my heart
"That, to lessen its ache,
"When I grieved for your sake,
"I bound round my heart."

Again, and yet once again there was the same sound,
and the prince thought it must be the wheel breaking,
but it was the breaking of the other bands from faithful Henry's heart,
because it was now so relieved and happy.
