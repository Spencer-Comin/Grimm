And once when the angels had all gone out, she thought:
    "Now I am quite alone, and I could peep in.
    "If I do it, no one will ever know."

She sought out the key, and when she had got it in her hand, she put it in the lock,
and when she had put it in, she turned it round as well.

Then the door sprang open, and she saw there the Trinity sitting in fire and splendour.

She stayed there awhile, and looked at everything in amazement;
then she touched the light a little with her finger, and her finger became quite golden.

Immediately a great fear fell on her.

She shut the door violently, and ran away.

Her terror too would not quit her, let her do what she might,
and her heart beat continually and would not be still;
the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away,
let her rub it and wash it never so much.
