During the cat's absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order,
but the greedy cat devoured all the rest of the fat.

"One has peace only after everything is eaten up,"
    he said to himself.

Well filled and fat, he did not return home until nighttime.

The mouse immediately asked what name had been given to the third child.

"You will not like it either,"
    said the cat.
"His name is All-Gone."

"All-Gone!,"
    cried the mouse.
"That is the most worrisome name of all.
"I have never seen it in print.
"All-Gone! What can that mean?"

Then she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.
