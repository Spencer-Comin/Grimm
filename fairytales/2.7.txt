From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godfather,
but when winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside,
the mouse thought of their stored food, and said,
    "Come cat,
    "we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves.
    "It will taste good now."

"Yes,"
    answered the cat.
"You will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking
"that dainty tongue of yours out of the window."

They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat,
to be sure, was still in its place, but it was empty.

"Alas,"
    said the mouse,
"now I see what has happened.
"Now it comes to light.
"You are a true friend.
"You ate everything when you were serving as a godfather.
"First top off, then half done, then..."

"Be quiet!"
    cried the cat.
"One more word, and I will eat you too."

"All gone," was already on the poor mouse's lips.

She had scarcely spoken it before the cat sprang on her,
seized her, and swallowed her down.

You see, that is the way of the world.
